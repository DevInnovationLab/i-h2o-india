{cmd:dropmiss} has been superseded by {helpb missings}.  {cmd:missings}
offers various utilities for managing variables that may have missing
values.  See the {cmd:missings} help file or see

{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2} 
{cmd:dropmiss} drops those variables in {it:varlist} for which all
(optionally, any) observations have missing values, that is, any of
{cmd:.} or {cmd:.a} to {cmd:.z} for a numeric variable or {cmd:""} for a
string variable.  {it:varlist} defaults to all variables. 

{p 4 4 2}
{cmd:dropmiss} with the {cmd:obs} option drops those observations for
which all (optionally, any) variables in {it:varlist} have missing
values. {it:varlist} defaults to all variables. 

{p 4 4 2} 
You can also simply type, for example, {cmd:drop if missing(myvar)}
or {cmd:drop if myvar == .} if that is desired.  


{title:Options}

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:obs} is required in the second syntax and specifies that
observations are to be dropped if their values are missing in {it:varlist}.

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:force} specifies that, even though the data in memory have
been changed, you do want to apply {cmd:dropmiss}. 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:any} specifies that variables or observations are to be
dropped if any values are missing in those variables or observations.
This can have drastic effects and may even result in the
dropping of all data. 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:trim} specifies that whether string values are missing 
should be determined after trimming leading and trailing spaces. For
example, {cmd:trim} {cmd:" "} (a single blank) would count as
missing. 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:piasm} specifies that {cmd:p}eriod {cmd:i}s {cmd:a}lso
{cmd:s}tring {cmd:m}issing; that is, {cmd:"."} counts as missing. Some
Stata users use {cmd:"."} to indicate missing values of string
variables. 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:trim piasm} would specify that, e.g., {cmd:" . "} counts as
missing. 


{title:Remarks} 

{p 4 4 2}
{cmd:dropmiss} is destructive.  Once variables or observations have been
dropped, they can not be reinstated except by once more reading in or
otherwise re-creating the data. As a reminder of the
destructive character of this command, users must specify the
{cmd:force} option to drop data if the data in memory have been changed. 


{title:Examples}

{phang2}{cmd:. dropmiss}{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. dropmiss, obs}

{p 4 4 2}With the {cmd:auto} dataset, 

{phang2}{cmd:dropmiss} {space 10} drops nothing{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:dropmiss, any} {space 5} drops {cmd:rep78}{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:dropmiss, obs} {space 5} drops nothing{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:dropmiss, obs any} {space 1} drops 5 observations for which {cmd:rep78} is missing

{title:Acknowledgments}

{p 4 4 2}Jeroen Weesie suggested adding {cmd:if} and {cmd:in}.  Estie Sid Hudes
prompted the addition of an optional varlist when the {cmd:obs} option is
specified and the addition of the {cmd:any} option.
