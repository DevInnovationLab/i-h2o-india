MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS DO FILE ü§ì

We are merging/appending main endline census long datasets with revisit endline census long datasets. Majorly we have 4 long datasets- Child, Women, Census Roster, New roster. So, after we are done making their appended versions. We will create one master individual dataset which will have these variables so this will serve two purposes: combined cleaning and analysis. Based on our conveninece we can drop the set that we don't want.

/* APPROACH FOR MERGING DATASETS: 

/////////////////////////////////////////
**Basic Explanation about prefixes
//////////////////////////////////////////

üòá Welcome to the toughest part of these datasets. If you are here that means you have come a long way. Let us dive into this! 

Revisit Endline census sections were divided into two types: 

####################################
üíÄ Variables with comb_ prefix 
######################################
comb_ signifies that this section would appear only for those cases which had imported names of children or women from the preload. This preload was created from the main endline census wherever survey of child or women was pending. 


üòµ‚Äçüí´Now, you might ask, Why is the meaning of this prefix different for main endline census? 
***********************************************************************
 So, main endline census also had the prefix system where N_ was used for new entries, it means not present already in the baseline census and Cen_ was used for entries which were from baseline census so the idea of comb_ comes from there. comb_ was a combined prefix which denoted that this is the combined data of the census and new entries. This process of combination was done in the file - 1_8_A_Endline_cleaning_HFC_Data_creation file. 
---> In case of endline revisit census, comb_ prefix includes both the cases from main endline census where name of the person was taken from baseline (i.e. with the cen prefix) and those people who are new and were not recorded in the baseline but their names were recorded in the main endline census. 


BUT.....WHY WAS THIS DONE? 

In endline revisit census, comb_ prefix was used to reflect cases of both Cen_ and N_ from main endline census because we wanted to ensure consistency as comb_ reflects the final form of the variable and dataset in general. If this was not done, then it would have created problems like-

i) Double new entries for eg- If we had used N_ to reflect those names from the revisit preload where where child or women was a case was new entry but they were re-visited again because they were unavailable in the main round of survey but thier names were recorded from the main respondent so we wanted to make sure we also revisit these new cases now lets say we would have used prefix N_ to reflect these entries this would have confused the person working on data because they would not have been able to differentiate between which are the new entries from main endline census and which are the entries from revisit endline census because hey we also wanted new entries data never recorded previosuly in the revisit too....(I know crazy) so differentiation had to be made which is new entry from main endline census and revisit endline census. Additionally, you would have to follow additional steps in bringing it to the comb_ form because ultimately this is the final form right?

ii) The survey CTO coding would become more complex becasue loop in survey cto runs separately for new member sections and comb_ sections because comb_ ones are the preloaded names so you need to import csv to get those names so if you had mixed this up it would have been extremely difficult to analyse. 

So, the most sensible choice was to use comb_ to represent both Cen_ and N_ entries for revisit census ( Now...that is a lot of knowledge dump right? More coming your way ü§™)

####################################
üíÄ Variables with N_ prefix 
####################################

By now you would know, what does N_ mean. These are new entries from endline revisit census that means they were not recorded anywhere nor in the main endline census becasue they are just revisit level new. 
	
Conclusion: That is why you see two prefix in the revisit form: comb_ and N_

where does this dataset comes from? Refer to this cleaning file: "GitHub\i-h2o-india\Code\1_profile_ILC\1_9_A_Endline_Revisit_cleaning.do"
Why- We are merging this over R_E_key because this is the only identifier to connect both of them and we want some other identifiers like UID, Village, enum label to use this dataset for basic cleaning and stats. That is why we are getting these variables from Endline_Revisit_Cleaned dataset

/* üòèWhy are there some unmatched keys? 
**********************************************
always always investigate why there are some cases that are not matched. The reason for this lies in the fact that endline revisit cleaned doesn't have those keys that were not appliacble for eg that ID could be a duplicate that is why the whole observation and key was dropped or this could be a training entry. The approach to investigate this would be to open the do file that creates 1_9_A_Endline_Revisit_cleaning dataset.

keys where _merge ==1 you will see that these keys are straight away getting dropped from 1_9_A_Endline_Revisit_cleaning.do

keys where _merge == 2 are also fine because the main dataset will always have more observations than a subset of the dataset in this case child dataset because not every housheold will have U5 children right so move on...... you are good to go!   */

********************************************************************************************************************************************************
/* NEXT WE NEED TO DROP ROWS FROM MAIN ENDLINE CHILD DATASET

What does this mean? üò± üò± üò±

See the purpose of collecting revisit data was to actually use these observations in our main dataset right ? So, how would we know which observations to keep and which to drop from both the datasets. The approach here would be to follow the following steps-

A) Rename the variables (comb_main_caregiver_label and  comb_child_caregiver_present) in the endline child revisit dataset. The logic behind this step would get  clearer. If these two varaibles are not re-named we won't able to identify the entry that we have to keep. 

B) After renaming these variables in the child revisit dataset we are going to merge this with main endline child dataset to see for eg Unique ID and child name which entry needs to be kept from main child dataset or revisit data. For ge- for the UID - 1234567 and the child name - Sukesh if in the main endline census dataset this child was unavailable and we have gotten good data for Sukesh in the revisit data we would need to remove Sukesh's entry from main child dataset and replace it with revisit entry but you won't be able to identify without 1:1 merge that is why we are comparing using 2 key variables - unique ID and child name variable (comb_child_comb_name_label) because if we don't use these two key varaibles we won't be able to perform 1:1 merge and how would you verify if this is actually unqiue across the two datasets? To verify that we are using the command- 
bysort unique_id comb_child_comb_name_label : gen dup_HHID = cond(_N==1,0,_n)
count if dup_HHID > 0 
tab dup_HHID
Tabulating this would tell us how many duplicate pairs are there. In our case, there are none so we are good to go!!! üöó üöó üöó
So, that is why we are renamining variables: comb_main_caregiver_label and  comb_child_caregiver_present because they are going to be used for verification if we are actually droppping the right entry or not! 

C) After you are done with merging, Flag the rows where in the main child dataset a particular entry of that specific unique ID alongwith the child name were unavailable because remember only unavailable IDs from the main endline census was given for revisit so we have no business in dropping actual valid observations where child was available in the main endline census so after you have flagged the observatiosn where child name and UID was unavailable you move to the next step (the variable to look for availability would be comb_child_caregiver_present)

D) After we have flagged these observations, we check if they are actually identical for eg - it shouldn't be the case that Sukesh's caregiver names are different! After you have done some manual comparison that you are actually looking at the smame UID and child name you go to step E

E) You generate a variable called gen to_drop = . and you then replace to_drop = 1  if Vcomb_child_caregiver_present == 1 & _merge == 3 (This means this is the entry where Sukesh's was marked as unavailable in the main endline child dataset but we have a valid entry for this in the revisit child dataset because 1 in the Vcomb_child_caregiver_present == 1 means that child was available in revisit and surveyed.) T
drop if to_drop == 1
That is the reason we are good to drop this entry from the main child dataset. We will see later how replacement with revisit data is done. 

//Finding duplicates can be done in two ways 

1. Way 1: Finding duplicates by bysorting by key and then wherever keys are repeated manually check if child names are same  (Most Preferred and most accurate)

2. Way 2:  Finding duplicates using key and child name. If they are no duplicats that means at each key, we have unique child names.

IMP NOTE: ONE DUPLICATE FOUND 

What does 111 prefix mean before the name? 
 Write 111- Name of the member if during baseline they were excluded from the criteria by writing the incorrect gender and age i.e. they should come in the criteria but they are not coming because either age or gender are wrongly recorded. 
 
 Additional instructions given to the enum for this:
 ********************************************************
 
 For eg- if in the baseline census women age was recorded as 40 but her gender is recorded as "Male" in this situation she is an eligible member so she should be included in the criteria so please add her in the new member roster and in the question "What is the name of household member?" please write 111- Name for eg if the name of the woman in census was kamla devi and she is 40 years old but her gender was marked as Male in this situation when you fill the roster for her when writing her name don't just write Kamla instead write 111-Kamla devi
111 would be now a code for any old census member you are adding in the new member roster because gender or age of the old census member was incorrect please note that this would be done only when the is coming in our criteria (either an U5 child, pregnant mother, child bearing women)
Only though this 111 we would get to know that this is an old member from the roster otherwise we won't know this. Please fill this carefully


 Please note that for this ID enum by mistake included  this child named "Ranbir/Ranveer Sabar" because this child no longer falls in the criteria and enum were supposed to re-enter names in the new roster using 111- only when these entries should have been included in the women or child loops but they weren't included because of wrong gender or age  so it was not required to re-enter this child because already in the child loop enum had shown that this child no longer falls in the criteria.

Objective of the exercise below: üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è
.........................................................................................................................................................
Instead of doing the replacement of the rows from the revisit data with the main dataset we are dropping the rows from the main dataset where that specific children on that Unique ID was unavailable (to check for unavailability look at this variable- comb_child_caregiver_present)  earlier but was revisited in the revisit round and was surveyed. We are avoid doing replacement of rows by using merge because m:m results in a lot of complication as a result we want to append it so that we can minimise discrepancies so we would append that data from the revisit dataset to the main dataset and remove the entry from the main census dataset to avoid having duplicates for such children where _merge == 3 that means they got matched with revisit data and they were unavailable in the main round 

Here the _merge == 3 entry of the matched entry indicates that this entry is also available in the using dataset (revisit dataset) but this is not enough to help us in deciding whether we want to drop this row or not from the main endline datatset that is why we use another variable called  Vcomb_child_caregiver_present that will tell us whether this survey was actually completed in the revisit or not. If Vcomb_child_caregiver_present is qual to 1 then that means that child became available later so we can add this data that was available to our main dataset and drop the unavailable child entry from the main dataset. We can keep all other matched entries from the main dataset because if they were also unavailable during revisit then it doens't make any sense to put in time and efforts to replace other entries.

OVERALL OBJECTIVE: 

We have 3 types of dataset here: 

1.  Type 1: "${DataRaw}1_8_Endline/1_8_Endline_Census-Household_available-survey_start-consented-N_HH_member_names_loop.dta"

This dataset contains information for new roster members that were inlcuded in the main endline census.  

2. Type 2: 
"${DataRaw}1_8_Endline/1_8_Endline_Census-Household_available-survey_start-consented-Cen_HH_member_names_loop.dta"

This dataset contains information about the census roster members that were inlcuded in the main endline census. The roster for this is different because we wren't collecting all the identifiers like age, sex, etc. for baseline census members we were just asking 2 questions that is if they are still a member or not and  Since September 2023 how many DAYS has ${name_from_earlier_HH} spent away from this village?

3. Type 3:  "${DataRaw}1_9_Endline_Revisit/1_9_Endline_Census-Household_available-WASH_applicable_start-survey_start-consented-Cen_HH_member_names_loop.dta"

This dataset contains information about the revisit dataset where those baseline census members were revisited whose information we were not able to get in the main endline census and since this was a section only for census members that s why there is no comb_ type variable here 

Our goal is to merge these 3 datasets and create a combined roster dataset

/*

CREATING COMBINED ENDLINE REVISIT ROSTER DATASET SO THAT IT CAN BE MERGED WITH MAIN ENDLINE ROSTER DATASETS 

OBJECTIVE: 

By now, you might have noticed the appraoch- 
1. We firstly merge census and new sections from main endline census 
2. Then we merge endline revisit sections- comb, cen_, n_ into comb 
3. After that we merge these two merged datasets to create one final dataset that has both revisit entries and main endline census entries 

The counterpart reviist dataset for new census members didn't have any entries that is why we are not using that for merging purposes that is why we are jumping directly into endline cenusus roster. There is no comb here because it was strictly only for census members so it didn't make sense to create a combined variable capturing new member entries too 

Drop here means we would have to drop those rows from the main endline long roster dataset where respondent was unavailable here and data couldn't be collcted so we need to add rows in replacement for this from revisit endline roster level dataset 

This dataset is created in the "GitHub\i-h2o-india\Code\1_profile_ILC\0_Preparation_V2_revisit.do"

The reason there are 0 matches is because this is a conditional section which means this section gets asked to the main respondent only when main respondent is available to answer this. So, in the temp0 dataset which is the main endline roster dataset it had only those entries where main respondent was available because in the cases where main respondent wasn't available there would be an empty entry that would be generated which we have already dropped ( check drop if name_from_earlier_hh == "") and the same logic applies for the revisit dataset for that reason when we merge these two datasets we get 0 matches so we don't need to worry as exactly this should happen.  To, the merged dataset has the entries where unavailable cases in main census were available and availabile cases from the main endline census 

Conclusion: No drop is required
