VARIABLE WISE 
Sheet name: diff_ratios
What does it reflect: This sheet contains information regarding variable wise percenatge of the observations where there is a difference in the answer to total observations with both differences and no differences 
Variable definitions- 

total_alldiffs: Sum of all the observations for each variable including the observations where there is a difference in the answers and the observations where there is no difference in the answer 
total_diffs: Sum of all the observations for each variable which includes only those observations where difference in the answers is more than 0 
var_diffs_ratio: Variable wise Percentage of the observations with differences to the total observations (no difference+ difference) 


FUZZY WISE
Sheet name: fuzzywise_ratios
Fuzzy = 1 : It means that respondent in the survey and BC was same
Fuzzy = 0 : It means that responden in the survey and BC was different 
What does it reflect: This sheet reflects the variable wise percentages when respondent was the same and when respondent was different
Variable defitions- 

total_alldiffs: Sum of all the observations for each variable including the observations where there is a difference in the answers and the observations where there is no difference in the answer 
all_diffs_res: Sum of all the observations for each variable which further gets classified into when respondent was same and different which includes all the observations with differences and no differnces 
not0_diffs_res: Sum of all the observations for each variable including only the cases where difference was more than 0 
percenatge_res_fuzzy_ratio: Variable wise Percentage of the observations where respondent was same or different with differnces in answers more than 0 to all the values inlcuding 0 and more than 0 differences 
percenatge_only1fuzzy: variable wise percenatge of observations which further gets classified into when the respodent was same aor different and differences are 0 to the total observations present without variable classification 

ENUM WISE 
Sheet name : enumwise_ratios
What does it reflect: This sheet reflects the enum wise percentages when respondent was the same and when respondent was different
Variable defition-
