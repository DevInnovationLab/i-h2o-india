# Output folder

This folder should contain code outputs such as tables and data visualizations. It can also store TeX file for presentations, papers and reports. Save figures and maps in PNG or SVG format, photos in JPG format, and tables in CSV or TXT format to track how your results change when your code changes.

## Suggested folder structure

```
output
|_ raw
   |_ figures
   |_ maps
   |_ tables
|_ final
   |_ paper.tex
   |_ presentation.tex
   |_ report.tex
   |_ bibliography.bib
```
- `final` and `raw` folders are only necessary is you are working on TeX files using GitHub. If you are not, you may not need them, and save output files directly to `output`
- The subfolders `figures`, `maps`, and `tables` are only necessary if you have a large enough number of files that it is difficult to navigate them in a single folder.
