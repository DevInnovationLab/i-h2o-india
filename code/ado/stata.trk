d 'IETOOLKIT': module providing commands specially developed for Impact Evaluations
d 
d  ietookit provides a set of commands that address different
d aspects of data management and data analysis in relation to
d Impact Evaluations. The list of commands will be extended
d continuously, and suggestions on new commands are highly
d appreciated. Some of the commands are related to standardized
d practices developed at the World Bankâ€™s unit for Impact
d Evaluations (DIME) and might not apply to practices adopted at
d other institutions. For these commands, the corresponding help
d files provide justifications for the standardized practices
d applied. ieduplicates and iecompdup are useful tools to identify
d and correct for duplicates. iebaltab is a tool for multiple
d treatment arm balance tables. ieboilstart standardizes the
d boilerplate code at the top of all do-files. iegraph produces
d graphs based on common impact evaluation regression models. See
d https://github.com/worldbank/ietoolkit for more details.
